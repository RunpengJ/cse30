have a current pointer and a next

before free current pointer
save the next one

if the next is null, done


it is not null the pointer, but the *(htable + i)

change the pointer in the hashtable to be null 

free table, reload table. 

if the table is not clear, the table will blode

almost same loops for the four functions - freetickets, largest, find summoun
